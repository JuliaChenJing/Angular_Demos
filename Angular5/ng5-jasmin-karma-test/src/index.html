    unit test
    exception test
    integration test

    In Angular, if you build your application using angular cli, you will have the whole test driver
    configured for you. So you will have the ProTractor,Jasmine and Karma available to you.

    Protractor basically helps you run your test against browser, you no longer have to add those 
    wait funciton and sleep function in your test, it will automatically figure out. When one step finishes,
    it would run the next step.

    Jasmine is your behavior driven test environment. So you are going to write your test in Jasmine. 
    Jasmine will allow you to structure your test code properly.

    Karma will help you to run these test in multiple browser,sometimes in the same time.

    You write your test in Jasmine, run in ProTractor, and it will allow you to do multiple browser using Karma.
